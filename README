tuna                    maybe the tiniest C++ game framework


Current state
------------------------------------------------------------

    At the moment, tuna is in public testing and may contain
bugs, memory and performance related issues.  You can
support the development of this project!  Create an issue if
you find a bug or contribute.


Description
------------------------------------------------------------

    tuna is a small header-only game development framework
written in C++.  What sets tuna apart from others is its
implementation approach.  tuna does not have a resource
manager, particle system, renderer, or anything like that.
All you get is the architecture.

    The relatively small header contains a component system
and a world model written in the OOP paradigm, which
provides a familiar user experience (similar to Unity).

    The decision to use OOP instead of ECS was made because
it is more flexible for 90% of games, has a smoother
learning curve, and is faster to develop and prototype.  If
performance is more critical to you, tuna is not the right
choice.


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------

    tuna is written in C++20 and uses its new features.  To
install, put tuna.hh in your include paths.  Or you can
clone this repository and add it as another path.  tuna has
no third-party dependencies, so don't worry.


Overview
------------------------------------------------------------

    tuna has three main architectural components: Script,
Object, and World.

    World is the place where all objects in the world are
located.  Its methods allow you to create objects, delete
objects, search for objects, and call Script methods on all
objects it stores.

    Object is a container of scripts.  It has no logic on
its own — it is provided by your scripts.  It has methods
for assigning a script to an object, as well as for deleting
and searching for a script.

    Script is the base class for your scripts.  It has
several virtual methods that form the game loop.

    Documentation, usage, features, decisions and tips can
be found in HANDBOOK file.  (HANDBOOK will be translated
into several languages.  Original was written in Russian)
